	can-0v1						
========================
Options:

-a	Sets the IF socat address.
	default: None(REQUIRED)
	alias: --address
	example: java -jar can-0v1.jar -a '10.10.3.1'

-b	Sets the base name for the data files. The resulting 
	filename will be [base-name][nnn].csv. [nnn] is the nth 
	data file created in this specific session. Note that 
	can-0v1 will overwrite files with the same name.
	default: DATA_
	alias: --base-name
	example: java -jar can-0v1.jar  -a [address] -b Experiment_

-d	Enables debugging statements. These include various
	status updates and output to the data files
	default: off
	alias: --debug
	example: java -jar can-0v1.jar  -a [address] -d

-dir	Sets the directory in which the data files will be 
	placed. 
	IMPORTANT: This is also the directory that the cgi-bin
		interface will clear when commanded to. If you set a 
		directory besides /var/www/html/data be sure you are careful 
		when clearing it. Make sure there are no .csv files in there 
		that you want to keep.  
	default: ./
	alias: --directory
	example: java -jar can-0v1.jar  -a [address] -dir /var/www/html/data

-f	Sets the maximum number of data files to create. After
	this number is reached, can-0v1 will exit quietly.
	default: off
	alias: --file-limit
	example: java -jar can-0v1.jar -a [address] -f 5

-help	Brings up this help screen
	example: java -jar can-0v1 -help

-i	Enables infinite data file. The logger will
	write to a single data file until it is stopped.
	The logger can be stopped through the -t option or
	the cgi-bin interface
	default: off
	alias: --infinite
	example: java -jar can-0v1.jar -a [address] -i

-l	Sets the maximum number of samples per data file
	Cannot be set when -i is used.
	default: 1000
	alias: --length
	example: java -jar can-0v1.jar  -a [address] -l 2500 	

-t	Sets a period of time in milliseconds for the logger to run
	After the specified time can-0v1 will exit quietly.
	default: off
	alias: -timed, --runtime	
	example: java -jar can-0v1.jar  -a [address] -t 5000

-s	If set then the logger will start recording data immediately.
	If this flag is not set the logger will wait for a 
	command from the cgi-bin interface to begin recording
	default: off
	alias: --start, --start-immediately

help 	Brings up the args4j generated helpscreen
	example: java -jar can-0v1 help
=========================
	bus master				
=========================
The busmaster is a c program which implements various Can related
functionalities. The busmaster also controls the sample rate.
Currently the only way to dynamically change the sample rate is through
the cgi-bin interface.
